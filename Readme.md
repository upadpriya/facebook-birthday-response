I wrote this code for fun on my 22nd Birthday (25 August 2014). It was one of the best birthdays thanks to friends and every birthday wish means a lot. My blog has a post about it.

Idea inspired from a post on quora: http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-Python-scripts-youve-ever-written
The code in that post uses FQL which is deprecated after v2.1. This implementation uses Facebook Graph API.
